# Send Email in Powershell

This is a powershell script i have learn in my previous job. i created a simple send-email script and obfuscation script.

I used send-email script as part of a large script to send password expiry notification for our employees in my previous job. 

at the same time i created the encrypt-decrypt script to encrypt the password of the email that is being used to send emails. This is for automation purposes.
